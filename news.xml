        <titulo>Boko Haram victim stigmatized</titulo>
        <data>data</data>
        <corpo>(CNN)Um Haleema was just 16 years old when she was kidnapped. Her first few months in captivity, at the hands of militant group Boko Haram, were enough to break anyone's spirit -- let alone that of a teenage girl so far from home.She was captured trying to escape, along with three of her friends, as Boko Haram burned and ransacked her village.During her captivity, Um Haleema was forced to watch men, women and children slaughtered. She was forced into marriage. Forced to wait on a "husband" she hated. But while she watched, she says she was also waiting -- for a chance to break free. And after six long months, it finally came."I had planned my escape from the beginning," she says. "There was a time my husband spent two weeks away, so I attempted to escape but guards returned me and beat me."Eventually, her captors' vigilance began to slip and she managed to escape. In her fear, all she remembers is walking for what felt like days until she finally reached safety.She arrived home to discover that her father had been killed by the same Boko Haram militants who had held her captive for almost a year. She also found she had become pregnant by her Boko Haram husband.Now, seven months along in her pregnancy, she has agreed to speak to CNN on the condition that we conceal her identity and change her name. She doesn't want to become the face of a growing crisis -- girls and women brutally victimized by Boko Haram.The fear, she says, is still with her. This time, though, it's the men in her own community she is scared of."People in this village are rejecting me because of the pregnancy," she says. "Some will be happy to have me dead. Many people are even saying that I should go for an abortion."It's an option she refuses to contemplate, even though she says local men have let it be known they will not tolerate the children of Boko Haram living amongst them. She says they have threatened to kill both her and her baby.There are no exact figures, but aid agencies and government officials have told CNN that an alarming percentage of girls rescued from Boko Haram have returned pregnant.The UNFPA, which is working in camps for Nigeria's internally displaced, reports that 214 women in the camps are visibly pregnant, but it is still assessing how many got pregnant while being held by Boko Haram, and if there are still more in the earlier stages of pregnancy."We do not know yet the total number of pregnant girls among those rescued," said Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in a report. "The screening is still ongoing." UNFPA said it is working to meet the medical, physical and psychological needs of the freed women.In recent months, Nigeria's military has raided several Boko Haram bases freeing captive women and children. In late April to early May, about 700 women and girls were rescued in separate operations.On hearing that her daughter had been abducted, Um Haleema's mother says she immediately feared the worst."Anybody captured by Boko Haram is presumed dead," she explains. "They abducted my step-daughterâ€Ž and my daughter. They took a total of seven girls from this house."She says she has heard of many mothers who felt that abortion was the only option they had, but insists it's not a risk she's willing to take with her daughter."We heard about one girl who died after she attempted an abortion, losing both the mother and the baby," she says. "The girl was the only child to her mother, so that scared us. If God wishes, she will give birth safely. Life is in the hands of God alone."CNN spoke to the men Um Haleema accused of threatening her in her village. Part of a local vigilante group, they denied making the threats.The vigilante groups in the north of Nigeria -- men who take up arms to protect their communities from Boko Haram -- have long been used by the Nigerian government in an auxiliary capacity to fight against the militants. Their leader agreed to speak CNN."I am not aware of any woman in this village who was impregnated by them," he said. "If any woman is found to be pregnant, in our tradition, the pregnancy is considered Haram (unlawful), hence we cannot accept them wholeheartedly because they can be like baby snakes."In Muslim communities, pregnancy outside of marriage is often seen as illegitimate, unless the mother can prove it was against her will.When the interview ended and the camera stopped rolling, the vigilante leader said that his group didn't believe Um Haleema had been forced into marriage and said that she and her unborn child will always be viewed with suspicion. But he refused to comment on what he and his men might do about it.Regardless of what others say, surviving both abduction and escape has made Um Haleema realize that she has the strength to see this through. Her child, she says, deserves to live.</corpo>

        <titulo>U.S. slams Russia's 'aggression'</titulo>
        <data>data</data>
        <corpo>(CNN)A senior U.S. diplomat, on a visit Thursday to Ukraine, has slammed what she calls Russian "aggression" in the country.Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, pledged support to Ukraine."US stands w/you as you fight on two fronts: countering Russian aggression and building an open, responsive govt," Power tweeted.Power is in Ukraine to help open a U.N.office that will support the Minsk agreement, which includes a ceasefire and other measures meant to resolve the crisis in eastern Ukraine, the Kiev Post reported Thursday.The U.S. diplomat met with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to discuss implementation of the accord."You cannot imagine how famous you are in Ukraine," Poroshenko joked at the beginning of the meeting, noting that a lot of people in Ukraine watched the broadcast of the meetings of the U.N. Security Council regarding the Ukrainian issue.Power's government website said she would speak Thursday at the October Palace in Kiev. Her remarks, the website said, would focus on the importance of Ukraine's reform efforts, and emphasize U.S. support for Ukrainians and for the country's territorial integrity and sovereignty "in the face of Russia's hostile actions in eastern Ukraine and continuing occupation of Crimea."Some international officials doubt that Russia is complying with the agreement.The unresolved crisis in eastern Ukraine has been a focus of many top-level international discussions this week. Early in the week, the G7 group of industrialized countries said that sanctions against Russia could be stiffened if Russia does not observe the terms of the Minsk agreement.And on Thursday, during a visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin to Italy, both he and the Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi underscored their support for the agreement.Power's website says she will meet senior government officials, members of parliament, people in the country who have been displaced from their homes, students and young people " to discuss the ongoing aggression by Russia in eastern Ukraine and the critical importance of Ukrainian governmental and civil society-led reform efforts."</corpo>

        <data>data</data>
        <corpo>Sydney (CNN)Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has described ISIS as a "death cult" that is targeting individuals and governments globally with a message to "submit or die" in a speech at the start of a regional counter extremism summit in Sydney today."This is not terrorism for a local grievance; this is terrorism with global ambitions," Abbott said. "You can't negotiate with an entity like this; you can only fight it."The two-day summit has brought together ministers, senior officials and observers from 27 countries, along with executives from social media groups including Google, Facebook and Twitter, and will examine ways countries can work regionally to combat extremist terrorism.Delegates to the conference will look at ways they can prevent the distribution of online propaganda and focus on the use of social media to recruit ISIS followers and radicalize young people.Recently Australia has taken measures to combat terrorism, including a controversial move to strip citizenship from known terrorists who are dual Australian nationals. The passports of 115 Australians have been canceled, nine others whose travel plans had been "suspect" have been suspended, and 14 passport applications have been refused.Abbott said a prime aim of the conference was to stop young people succumbing to the lure of online recruiters."Above all, we need idealistic young people to appreciate that joining this death cult is an utterly misguided and wrong-headed way to express their desire to sacrifice," he said.Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said any solution should focus on the important role women can play in combating the "radicalization process."Bishop said women now account for one fifth of all foreign fighters joining ISIS."Women are fighting, joining their foreign fighter husbands, seeking to find partners or are otherwise providing support for terrorist organizations," she said.Bishop said "it defies all comprehension" that women -- one of biggest victims of ISIS -- continue to support extremist groups."It is vital that we remove any romanticism or idealism about the motives of groups like Da'esh (ISIS) -- who are not freedom fighters or religious warriors -- they are criminal gangs that extort money, murder innocent people and commit crimes such as the rape of women and children."READ: Australian teens held after 'ISIS-inspired' plot</corpo>

        <titulo>New 'Fifty Shades' book stolen</titulo>
        <data>data</data>
        <corpo>London (CNN)A finished copy of a new "Fifty Shades" book told from protagonist Christian Grey's perspective has been stolen ahead of the novel's release next week, its UK publisher confirmed Thursday.Author E.L James announced plans on June 1 to publish the book, "Grey: Fifty Shades of Grey as Told by Christian."The scheduled release date -- June 18 -- coincides with the protagonist's birthday, as devoted fans of the "Fifty Shades" novels may know.The theft may prompt fears that extracts or details of the book will be leaked ahead of that date.A statement from the book's UK publisher, Penguin Random House UK, said: " 'Grey' will be published on June 18th -- Christian Grey's birthday -- as planned."We can confirm that the Kent police are investigating the theft of a finished copy of E.L. James's new book 'Grey.' We will not be issuing any further statement."A spokeswoman for the Kent police, in southeastern England, said officers "are making inquiries after receiving a report that a book had been stolen on June 8."The novel is due to be published in the United States by Vintage Books, part of Random House.James said in a statement posted on her site last week that she had written the book after receiving requests from "thousands of readers" for Christian's point of view."Christian is a complex character and readers have always been fascinated by his desires and motivations, and his troubled past. Also, as anyone who has ever been in a relationship knows, there are two sides to every story," James said.Anne Messitte, Vintage Books publisher and James' editor, was quoted on the website as saying the new book has "all the compelling attributes of its predecessors" and that she was excited for its readers.The trilogy of "Fifty Shades of Grey," "Fifty Shades Darker" and "Fifty Shades Freed" caught Hollywood's attention, and the first book was made into one of the most highly anticipated films of 2015. The film starred Jamie Dornan as Christian and Dakota Johnson as his love interest, Anastasia. It's made more than $166 million since its release on February 14.The sequel, "FIfty Shades Darker," is set to arrive in theaters in 2017.</corpo>

        <titulo>Beijing courts Aung San Suu Kyi</titulo>
        <data>data</data>
        <corpo>(CNN)Myanmar's opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has met Chinese President Xi Jinping as she begins a trip that will emphasize the Nobel laureate's apparent transition from human rights defender to pragmatic politician.Suu Kyi met Wednesday with Wang Jiarui, a senior official of the Chinese Communist Party, shortly after touching down in the Chinese capital, according to China's state-run media. Wang is vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and head of the International Department of the Communist Party's Central Committee.Suu Kyi also met with Xi, and she is scheduled to meet with Premier Li Keqiang during her trip, according to her party, the National League for Democracy.Observers say China hopes that the June 10-14 visit, a party-to-party meeting between the National League for Democracy and the Chinese Communist Party, will allow the country to boost its waning influence in its southern neighbor, which has increased engagement with the West during dramatic political reforms in recent years.Meanwhile, Suu Kyi's first visit to China offers an opportunity to burnish her credentials as a stateswoman before national elections later this year, said Aung Zaw, editor-in-chief of The Irrawaddy, a news magazine which specializes in covering politics in Myanmar and Southeast Asia."She's been dubbed a darling of the West, but she's showing she's someone they can work with," he said.Activists are calling on Suu Kyi, who was held under house arrest for nearly 15 years by Myanmar's former military junta, to speak out on human rights issues during her visit to China, which is cracking down on dissent.In particular, Human Rights Watch's Sophie Richardson said in a statement, Suu Kyi should call for the immediate release of her fellow Nobel Peace Prize winner, the writer Liu Xiaobo, who is serving an 11-year sentence for "inciting subversion of state power" by calling for political reform and human rights.But observers say any such move is unlikely."I don't think Beijing is inviting her as an icon of democracy," said Zaw. "I think they're seeing her as a politician who is ready to play."The 69-year-old leader of Myanmar's opposition National League for Democracy has been criticized since her release from house arrest in 2010 for her failure to speak up regarding causes in her country, notably the persecution of the Rohingya Muslim minority, which has created a refugee crisis in the region."The Aung San Suu Kyi we used to know and the one we know today are very different," said Zaw, adding that she had also disappointed some people when a commission she led had approved a controversial Chinese-operated copper mine over the objections of protesters."She has become a politician," Zaw said. "She's no longer a human rights activist."David Mathieson, a senior researcher on Asia for Human Rights Watch, told CNN that China's leaders are confident that Suu Kyi will not embarrass them."Beijing is probably... calculating that Suu Kyi's refusal to speak out on many human rights issues in her own country means she is unlikely to speak out about China's denial of democracy and appalling human rights record," Mathieson said.READ MORE: Why is Aung San Suu Kyi silent on the Rohingya issue?Suu Kyi's visit comes at a turbulent time in the relationship between China and Myanmar.Myanmar, also known as Burma, relied on its northern neighbor as a diplomatic ally and investor during the decades when it was an international pariah state ruled by an authoritarian military junta.But since political reforms in 2011, relations between China and Myanmar's quasi-military government have run "hot and cold" due to a number of issues, said Zaw.In March, five people were killed in China's Yunnan province when a shell from fighting between Myanmar government troops and ethnic Kokang rebels strayed across the border.And China, the largest investor in Myanmar, has been unhappy when major infrastructure projects it has backed, such as the Myitsone dam, have been suspended due to protests."China's leaders can no longer trust Burma's military-backed civilian government to guarantee its many interests in the country," said Mathieson.By building bridges with Suu Kyi, China was underlining its interest in Myanmar, said Zaw."Everyone is coming to play the game over there and I think China is telling them they're a stakeholder," he said.While Suu Kyi cannot run for president -- a clause in Myanmar's military-drafted constitution bars her, as someone who has been married to a foreigner -- her party will likely be more powerful in the new government, said Mathieson."This is China hedging its bets by expanding their relationship with her," he said.The move could also be read as a snub to Myanmar's quasi-military government in light of recent tensions. "The invitation will no doubt upset the Burmese government," said Zaw.A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said at a briefing Tuesday that the visit was intended to "further enhance mutual understanding between the two parties, and move forward the China-Myanmar friendly and cooperative relations."Meanwhile, China's state-run Global Times was upbeat about the visit, saying in an editorial it believed Suu Kyi would "become a good friend of China's."CNN's Shen Lu contributed to this report.</corpo>

        <data>data</data>
        <corpo>Washington (CNN)President Barack Obama's administration is planning to train Sunni tribes' fighters as part of its move to send up to 450 additional U.S. forces to Iraq, the White House said Wednesday.The United States is also sending weapons to Sunni tribes, as well as the Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, who are operating under Iraqi command, in order to fight the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.The hope, an Obama administration official said, is that a new "Sunni uprising" similar to one that took place in 2013 will occur - but this time, aimed at Islamic State fighters."This is designed to focus on training the Sunnis," the official said.The additional U.S. military personnel will train and advise Iraqi and tribal troops at the Taqaddum military base in eastern Anbar province.Sunni fighters will continue with the standard practice of undergoing a security review by the Iraq's before they are permitted to join, to ensure they do not have loyalties to ISIS, the official said.RELATED: Obama says 'no complete strategy' in training Iraqi troopsThe Associated Press was the first to report earlier Tuesday that the administration was considering sending up to 1,000 U.S. forces to the country.Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey told reporters traveling with him in Jerusalem on Tuesday that Obama has asked military brass to "take a look at what we've learned over the last eight months in the train-and-equip program and make recommendations to him on whether there are capabilities that we may want to provide to the Iraqis to actually make them more capable."RELATED: Rumsfeld defends remarks about democracy in Iraq"He's asked us to look at whether there are other locations where we might establish training sites," Dempsey said. "He's asked us to take a look at how we might develop Iraq's leaders."There are currently about 3,050 U.S. forces in Iraq. Roughly 2,250 of them are devoted to supporting Iraqi security forces, approximately 450 are training Iraqi troops and about 200 more are acting in advising and assisting roles.CNN's Jim Acosta contributed to this report.</corpo>

        <corpo>(CNN)Al Jean, the executive producer and showrunner for "The Simpsons," would like fans to stop freaking out about Homer and Marge's marriage.After Variety reported that Jean said the pair will legally separate in the upcoming season, there was much wailing and gnashing of teeth.It was only one of the bombshells about the long-running series that have dropped recently; another is that Bart Simpson will be "killed" by Sideshow Bob on the annual Halloween episode.D'oh! Homer and Marge set to split on 'The Simpsons'But hold on, Jean tweeted that he never said "divorce" (nor did we!), and viewers will find that out September 27, when the episode airs.We see what you did there, Al.The show also tweeted and posted on its Facebook page a picture of Bart writing on the blackboard "Homer and Marge are not breaking up." The tweet requested that fans "RT and stop the rumors!"Fans know that each episode starts with Bart writing something (often ironic) on the school chalkboard.Taking a stab at more controversy, Jean tweeted, "I DIDN'T SAY Homer and Marge are breaking up I said they are BIGGER THAN JESUS."Of course, such tidbits are meant to keep folks coming back for more as the series heads into its 27th season. It now seems that the split of Marge and Homer -- who Jean said will fall in love with a pharmacist voiced by "Girls" star Lena Dunham -- may be as brief as the "death" of Bart.Entertainment Weekly quoted Jean as saying that Sideshow Bob will finally succeed in murdering Bart on the Halloween episode. Not to worry, as the main character will return healthy and alive in the next episode.</corpo>

        <titulo>Brazil star: Pick me for FIFA head</titulo>
        <data>data</data>
        <corpo>(CNN)Brazilian great Zico is the latest former professional footballer intent on succeeding FIFA president Sepp Blatter.Frenchman David Ginola and Portugal's Luis Figo both threw their hats into the ring ahead of last month's presidential election, only to both ultimately pull out of the race.Blatter went on to be re-elected for a fifth term, before announcing his resignation following the launch of separate investigations by the U.S. and Swiss authorities into alleged corruption within FIFA.The election of Blatter's successor is believed to be set for December, and former Brazil star Zico, whose full name is Arthur Antunes Coimbra, wants to shake up the way world football is run."I would like to confirm the decision to be a candidate," Zico told a news conference in Rio de Janeiro. "I feel I am capable. For sure, certain rules need to change."It's sad for our sport to see what is happening in football today -- the corruption... and the hard work of many other good people wasted."I see it as my duty to use my experience and knowledge to try and stand for the presidency."Former France international Ginola, whose bid was controversially backed by betting company Paddy Power, withdrew from the presidential race in January after failing to receive the backing of five football federations required to stand in the election.The 48-year-old Ginola, however, has said in the wake of Blatter's resignation that he wants to put himself forward once again.Ex-Portugal captain Figo, meanwhile, pulled out just a week before the election, referring to the process as "a plebiscite for the delivery of absolute power to one man -- something I refuse to go along with."Zico, who represented his nation at three World Cups but never won the competition, admits he may also struggle to gather enough support like his fellow ex-professionals."That need to have five federations behind you, I think that is where the corruption starts," said the Brazilian."Of course, changes in the rules of the game would be necessary. Mainly because with the rules in place now there isn't the slightest possibility [of being elected]."Zico has little administrative experience in the world of football but said it was after speaking to Figo that he decided to stand for the role of FIFA president."I was asked if I had talked with Figo about his being a candidate for FIFA," he said. "I said I had and that set me thinking."Considered one of Brazil's greatest ever players, Zico played most of his club football with Brazilian side Flamengo, before moving to play in Italy and Japan.The 62-year-old has also coached all over the world, taking charge of the Japan and Iraq national teams as well as the likes of Turkish side Fenerbahce and Russian club CSKA Moscow.Meanwhile FIFA has handed over computer data to the Swiss authorities following a raid of the governing body's headquarters.Swiss authorities opened an investigation into corruption involving the bidding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups last month.The Swiss Office of the Attorney General (OAG) spokesperson confirmed the seizure of IT data to CNN."Today, FIFA handed over seized IT Data to the OAG," a statement read. "As already communicated, the OAG has opened criminal proceedings against persons unknown."The OAG is currently analyzing seized data and information. The OAG won't go into details as criminal proceedings are still under way."Reportedly Blatter is believed to be among those whose office was involved in the raid, while data from the offices of secretary general Jerome Valcke and the organization's financial chief Markus Kattner is also said to have been released to Swiss police.Emirates CEO Tim Clark has also spoken out about his company's decision not to renew its sponsorship deal with FIFA in November.Clark said Emirates chose not to renew with FIFA because the commercial terms were not right, but added it could make a U-turn when Blatter departs and "if things are sorted out in FIFA.""We are glad we're not in the space at the moment because of the fallout over the last few weeks," Clark told CNN's Richard Quest."It is a big pity, the big loser of course is football. Let's hope we can get it back onto some kind of track, it becomes the beautiful sport that it is, the sponsors are back in competing against each other to get on the tournament, because it is a hugely competitive battle to get that kind of exposure, but it's worth it."A number of current FIFA sponsors have warned the governing body to clean up its act in light of the corruption scandal, while Sony last week demanded an investigation into allegations over the controversial awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar.</corpo>

        <titulo>Pool party cop 'emotional'</titulo>
        <data>data</data>
        <corpo>(CNN)There's more to Eric Casebolt than the video that showed the former police corporal slamming a bikini-clad teenage girl to the ground in McKinney, Texas, his lawyer told reporters Wednesday.And there's more to that day than those seven minutes caught on video, attorney Jane Bishkin said."The video that everyone has seen only depicts a small part of Eric's actions that day," Bishkin said, noting that Casebolt had responded to two suicide calls earlier Friday.Casebolt resigned on Tuesday, days after a YouTube video showing his response to reports of fighting at a McKinney pool party sparked swift allegations of racism.Critics decried the white officer for cursing at several black teenagers, unholstering and waving his gun at boys and throwing the 14-year-old girl to the ground, his knees pressed down on her back.Bishkin said the suicide calls Casebolt dealt with earlier in his shift that day took an "emotional toll" on the 10-year veteran of the force.The officer's first stop of the day was an apartment complex, where a man had shot himself in the head in front of his family by the pool. Then, he headed to a home where a teenage girl was threatening to jump off her parents' roof. There, Casebolt helped calm the girl down so she could be taken to the hospital, Bishkin said.When reports of possible trespassing at a pool in McKinney's Craig Ranch neighborhood came through, Casebolt was "reluctant to respond ... given what he had just been through," his attorney said. But he felt it was duty to go to the scene after there were reports of "possible violent assaults," she said. The video tells some of the story, but not all of it, his attorney said."With all that happened that day, he allowed his emotions to get the better of him," Bishkin said. "Eric regrets that his conduct portrayed him and his department in a negative light. He never intended to mistreat anyone, but was only reacting to a situation and the challenges it presented. He apologizes to all who are offended. That day was not representative of the 10-year service to the community of McKinney, and it is his hope that by his resignation the community may start to heal."His attorney said that race had nothing to do with how the officer responded."He believed that those who fled were possible suspects," Bishkin said. "He was not targeting minorities. In fact, he also detained a white female who you do not see on the video. His effort to gather information was hampered by some teenagers who were instructing others to defy police instructions."Bishkin said the former officer didn't appear at a press conference Wednesday because he's faced death threats since the video went viral."He's worried for his family. He's worried he may be followed," she said. "And until that threat subsides, he's going to be in an undisclosed location."Only one person was arrested after Friday's incident, and the charges against him were later dropped, police said Tuesday.McKinney's police chief has called Casebolt's actions "indefensible," but said it's too soon to say whether the former officer will face charges over what happened."Our policies, our training, our practice, do not support his actions," Chief Greg Conley said. "He came into the call out of control, and as the video shows, was out of control during the incident."While the police chief said Casebolt's actions were clearly unjustified, opinions vary as to whether race played a role.The police union defended the former officer."He was a dedicated and decorated officer who in this instance was placed in a high-stress environment that he was not fully prepared for," Daniel Malenfant of the McKinney Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #107 told reporters, noting that Casebolt had won an "officer of the year" award in the past for his service.Dajerria Becton, the girl seen taken to the ground by Casebolt, told local station KDFW she had obeyed the officer's order to leave."He told me to keep walking," she said. "And I kept walking, and then I'm guessing he thought we were saying rude stuff to him."That's when things got physical, she said."He grabbed me, twisted my arm on my back and shoved me in the grass and started pulling the back of my braids," Becton told KDFW.In the video, the officer places her hands behind her and kneels on her back."I was telling him to get off me because my back was hurting bad," Becton said.Becton wasn't charged, McKinney police said.An attorney representing Becton said the 15-year-old has been having a hard time and sleeping and eating since the incident. She's shaken by what happened -- and by all the media attention that has turned the once-anonymous teenager into a face seen around the world, attorney Hannah Stroud told reporters.Stroud said police violated Becton's civil rights, but she's still investigating what happened and trying to decide on her next steps.At this point, one thing is clear, she said: Casebolt's resignation shouldn't put an end to the police investigation.And no matter how difficult the officer's day was before he came to the pool, she said, nothing justifies how he responded."Each of us operates under stress. There are appropriate ways to handle stress," she said, "and Officer Casebolt's actions were clearly in no way appropriate, and they also do not provide a defense for what occurred."Opinion: Pool party incident has everything to do with raceCNN's Nick Valencia, Jason Morris, Christopher Lett and Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.</corpo>

        <titulo>Putin: Sanctions on us cost Italy</titulo>
        <data>data</data>
        <corpo>(CNN)Russian President Vladimir Putin, on a visit to Italy, said Wednesday that sanctions imposed on his home country also have cost Italian businesses millions of dollars.The comments came after Putin met with Prime Minister Matteo Renzi.The Russian leader later met with Pope Francis, who gave Putin a medallion depicting the angel of peace, Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said. The Vatican called it "an invitation to build a world of solidarity and peace founded on justice."Putin, who arrived at the Vatican an hour behind schedule, gave the pope an embroidery of the Cathedral of Christ the Savior in Moscow.Lombardi said the pontiff and President talked for 50 minutes about the violence in Iraq and Syria and the crisis in Ukraine.The Pope has angered Catholics in Ukraine because, in his search for peace, he has failed to condemn Russian actions in the country.Both Putin and Renzi said full implementation of an accord reached in February in Minsk, Belarus, is critical. The accord includes a ceasefire and also calls for the removal of heavy weapons by both sides, along with other measures."The Minsk agreement is the compass by which we should be guided," Renzi said. "It is our polar star."Putin, too, called for "full implementation of the Minsk agreement." But some international officials doubt that Russia is respecting the accords.Just this week, leaders of the G7 group of industrialized countries meeting in Germany were sharply critical of Russia's actions in Ukraine, one of its neighbors to the west and a former republic in the Soviet Union.German Chancellor Angela Merkel said at the meeting that other countries were "ready, should the situation escalate -- which we don't want -- to strengthen sanctions if the situation makes that necessary."And President Barack Obama, in unusually harsh language, accused Putin of doing his own country serious harm."Ultimately, this is going to be an issue for Mr. Putin," Obama said. "He's got to make a decision: Does he continue to wreck his country's economy and continue Russia's isolation in pursuit of a wrongheaded desire to recreate the glories of the Soviet empire? Or does he recognize that Russia's greatness does not depend on violating the territorial integrity and sovereignty of other countries?"But Putin said Wednesday in Italy that the sanctions cut both ways. Russia's trade with Italy had fallen sharply, he said. And 400 Italian firms are working in Russia, he said."Italian companies did not receive millions of dollars ... because of the sanctions," he said.CNN's Damien Ward contributed to this report.</corpo>

        <corpo>(CNN)Police in Malaysia have arrested four foreigners believed to have been part of a group of tourists who stripped naked at the summit of Mount Kinabalu, according to Bernama, Malaysia's official news agency.The arrested tourists were two Canadian brothers, a Dutch woman and a British woman aged between 20 and 33, said Jalauddin Abdul Rahman, police commissioner in the eastern Malaysian state of Sabah.The British woman was arrested by police at Tawau Airport on Tuesday as she was about to leave for the capital Kuala Lumpur, Bernama reported.The other three turned themselves in on Tuesday evening.A local magistrate's court said they would be held for four days while the "obscene act" that took place the mountain was investigated.The suspects could face up to three months in jail or a fine if convicted.The mountain was shaken by an earthquake Friday in which at least 16 people were killed.The indigenous people of Sabah believe the tourists' behavior on May 30, deemed disrespectful of local culture, angered the spirit of the mountain and was the reason for the earthquake, Bernama reported.The tourists names were not released.CNN attempted to reach the Malaysian Foreign Ministry and Sabah's deputy chief minister Tuesday for comment, without success.Jalauddin said police were still looking for the other tourists who stripped on the mountain.Among those killed Friday were several students and at least one teacher from a primary school in Singapore who were on a trip to Mount Kinabalu when the magnitude-6.0 quake struck.Many made it out alive -- including 167 climbers helped to safety by mountain guides, Malaysia's fire and rescue department said Sunday.The UNESCO-listed Mount Kinabalu National Park -- including the namesake peak, which rises to 4,095 meters (13,435 feet) above sea level -- is a geographic jewel in Malaysian Borneo.It's so popular that visitors have to book two to three months in advance to secure one of 196 daily allocated hiking permits.It's not the first time tourists have made headlines for failing to keep their clothes on at tourist attractions.Cambodia deported two U.S. tourists for allegedly taking nude pictures at Angkor Archaeological Park after a string of nudity-related incidents hit the religious sites early this year.At least eight tourists were detained in three separate incidents for getting naked and posing for photos in Machu Picchu, the 15th-century Inca citadel in Peru last year.Journalist Chan Kok Leong in Kuala Lumpur and CNN's Maggie Wong in Hong Kong contributed to this report.</corpo>
