        <titulo>FIFA halts 2026 bids amid scandal</titulo>
        <data>data</data>
        <corpo>(CNN)FIFA Secretary General Jerome Valcke said Wednesday that FIFA would "postpone" the bidding process for the 2026 World Cup, as investigations continue into allegations that bribery helped determine the hosts of earlier World Cups.World soccer's governing body had expected to allocate the 2026 tournament to a host nation in 2017, with the bidding process to start soon, Valcke said, but in the current situation, it's "nonsense to start any bidding process for the time being."FIFA said Monday that there are no legal grounds for it to take the 2018 World Cup from Russia or the 2022 event from Qatar.Speaking to reporters while on a visit to Russia on Wednesday, Valcke said preparations for hosting the 2018 World Cup were "on track."FIFA has been embroiled in scandal since the United States indicted 14 people, including nine top FIFA officials, on corruption charges last month. Swiss authorities simultaneously opened a separate investigation into how the 2018 and 2022 World Cup were awarded.The U.S. indictment accuses Jack Warner, FIFA's former vice president and a member of parliament in Trinidad and Tobago, of taking a $10 million bribe to vote for South Africa to host the 2010 World Cup. The indictment says South Africa was willing to pay $10 million to the Caribbean Football Union "to support the African diaspora" in exchange for Warner's and two other conspirators' votes to put the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, instead of Morocco. The South African bid committee has denied any impropriety in the payment.Valcke also strenuously denied any wrongdoing in connection with the $10 million payment.He said Wednesday that he had signed off on the transfer of funds from South Africa to the Caribbean Football Union, as it was in line with the rules, but that the money was not FIFA's and that the global body could not control how its members dealt with funds."Why is it FIFA who has to explain the misuse of the money? It was not FIFA's money. We have nothing to do with this money. I have no more answer about this case," he said.He also insisted that FIFA "has never been described as a corrupt organization" and that every penny it spent of its own funds was closely audited.Valcke suggested that the media was out to bring him down, after the announcement by FIFA President Sepp Blatter last week that he would resign as the body's head."You have decided that after Blatter, I have to be the head to cut," he said to the gathered reporters.Russia has insisted that its right to host the World Cup in 2018 is not in question.Speaking alongside Valcke, Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said his country was "acting in the framework of the legislative basis" when it made its winning bid and had nothing to hide."I don't see any threats to our championship because we have worked, we really know what we're doing. We want to leave behind something that is great for the future," he said.FIFA: No grounds to strip Russia or Qatar of World CupThe Sunday Times of London reported over the weekend that secret tapes exposing the rigged voting process for the 2010 Cup were suppressed by FIFA and Blatter, until their release last week.The BBC reported Sunday that documents show three wire transfers totaling $10 million from FIFA to accounts of the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football, which were controlled by Warner, beginning in the winter of 2008. Then, the documents suggest, Warner used that money for cash withdrawals, personal loans, and to launder money, the BBC reported.There was no immediate response from Warner to those reports in British media.In all, U.S. prosecutors allege FIFA officials took more than $150 million in bribes to provide "lucrative media and marketing rights" to soccer tournaments.Complete coverage on FIFACNN's Aleks Klosok contributed to this report.</corpo>

        <titulo>FIFA: No grounds to strip Russia or Qatar of World Cup</titulo>
        <data>data</data>
        <corpo>(CNN)There are no legal grounds for FIFA to take the 2018 World Cup from Russian or the 2022 event from Qatar, soccer's world governing body said Monday.FIFA's statement followed comments made to a Swiss newspaper by Domenico Scala, chief of its Compliance Committee.Scala had said that Russia and Qatar could lose the right to host the World Cup events if evidence is presented showing that bribes bought the votes that won them the competition to host the world's biggest single-sport event."Should evidence be present that the awarding to Qatar and Russia only came about with bought votes, then the awarding could be void," Scala told the newspaper.But on Monday, FIFA issued a statement calling that claim into question."Russia and Qatar were awarded the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups by democratic vote of the Executive Committee. Based on expert opinions and available facts, FIFA has no legal grounds to take away the hosting of the FIFA World Cup from Russia and Qatar.""We will not speculate on possible scenarios and therefore have no further comments for the time being," the statement said.Whispers of foul play that started after December 1, when FIFA chose Russia and Qatar to host soccer's most prominent global competition, have been bandied about more openly now that FIFA is embroiled in a massive scandal, which involves allegations that bribery helped determine the hosts of earlier World Cups. The United States has indicted 14 people, including nine top FIFA officials, on corruption charges.FIFA had portrayed the ongoing investigation as a progressive step for the world soccer body. Russia, the world's largest country, and Qatar, a small Middle Eastern nation, would be new frontiers for the world's favorite tournament."If there is a problem in the bidding process ... then the problem is more with FIFA than with Russia and with Qatar," Guido Tognoni, a former FIFA adviser, told CNNI.When asked whether his gut told him bribery was part of the bidding process, he said: "It would not be a surprise."The CEO of Russia World Cup 2018 told CNN's Matthew Chance last week that Russia plans to continue to prepare to organize the event. Alexey Sorokin said that Russia's bid was transparent."It was clean," he said. "It didn't transgress any FIFA practices, any practices applicable to the bidding process. What else can we say?"And Qatar's Supreme Committee for Delivery &amp; Legacy released a statement last week, saying, "The recent events at FIFA will not impact on our preparations for the 2022 FIFA World Cup."READ: Read Sepp Blatter's resignation speechAmerican Chuck Blazer, a former FIFA executive committee member and key member of the U.S. investigation into the governing body, admitted that he and other high-ranking officials took bribes ahead of the 1998 and 2010 World Cups, according to court records.Trinidad's justice and legal affairs minister is calling on Jack Warner, the lone indicted FIFA official from his country, to go to New York to face trial in the scandal that's struck the soccer world like a dirty slide tackle."Trinidad and Tobago is not Jack Warner," Minister Prakash Ramadhar of the Caribbean nation said Sunday. "It really is about restoring a sense of decency to the politics of Trinidad and Tobago. And we made a call to Mr. Warner to save us all from the infamy that he has brought upon us to go hastily to America and have his trial. And if he has truth to bring, let it be so, so that we can put this behind us and learn from the errors of the past, and move on to ensure we do not repeat them in the future."Warner is the former vice president of soccer's international governing body. He and his 13 fellow defendants have been charged by the U.S. Justice Department with a total of 47 counts of racketeering, wire fraud, money laundering, bribery and other offenses. Interpol notified member nations on Wednesday that arrest warrants have been issued for Warner and five of the other indicted officials.Ramadhar, a long-time political adversary of Warner's in Trinidad and Tobago, said Warner is inviting ridicule of their homeland and questioned why Warner won't go directly to New York to face charges."I am a lawyer and I know the innocent rush to an early trial," Ramadhar said.Blatter stands downSince U.S. prosecutors handed down the indictment on May 26, Warner has threatened to expose the inner workings of FIFA and its president, Sepp Blatter, who was recently re-elected to a fifth term but just days later announced he would step down.On Wednesday, Warner released a paid political TV ad, titled "Jack Warner: The Gloves are Off," in which he said he had prepared a comprehensive series of documents on FIFA's transactions, including checks and corroborated statements.In the ad, aired in Trinidad and Tobago, Warner said he would "no longer keep secrets for those persons who now seek actively to destroy this country's hard-won international image."He also said, "I reasonably and surely fear for my life." He did not elaborate.Warner, head of Trinidad and Tobago's Independent Liberal Party, has denied all the charges against him and said in a statement that he had not been interviewed by authorities and "the actions of FIFA no longer concern me."Should FIFA elect a woman to replace Sepp Blatter?The indictment accuses Warner of taking a $10 million bribe to vote for South Africa to host the 2010 World Cup, saying South Africa was willing to pay $10 million to the Caribbean Football Union "to support the African diaspora" in exchange for Warner's and two other conspirators' votes to put the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, instead of Morocco.

        <titulo>Ex-FIFA official Jack Warner promises to spill secrets of FIFA, Sepp Blatter</titulo>
        <data>data</data>
        <corpo>(CNN)Former senior FIFA official Jack Warner, indicted in a wide-ranging bribery scandal, has promised to unleash a tide of evidence relating to the dealings of world soccer's governing body and its president, Sepp Blatter.Warner said he fears for his life but it is time to stop keeping secrets for others.The revelations came first in a paid political ad, titled "Jack Warner: The Gloves are Off," in which he said he had prepared a comprehensive series of documents on FIFA's transactions, including checks and corroborated statements.They have been placed in "different and respected hands," he said. "There can be no turning back."In the TV ad, aired in his native Trinidad and Tobago on Wednesday, Warner said he would "no longer keep secrets for those persons who now seek actively to destroy this country's hard-won international image."He also said, "I reasonably and surely fear for my life."Warner, who has so far not produced any documents or other physical evidence to support his claims, has displayed some erratic behavior in recent days as the scandal has widened.He scored a public relations own-goal Sunday by citing an article by satirical news outlet The Onion in an attempt to counter criminal charges against him and prove the United States was pursuing its own agenda in the investigation.And last week, shortly after he left a Trinidad and Tobago jail in an ambulance -- having reportedly been released on bail on the grounds of exhaustion -- he concluded a news conference in which he accused the United States of a "witch hunt" by dancing and singing, "Don't worry about a thing."Warner took a more sober tone in his political ad. And shortly after it aired, the 72-year-old again promised to impart information about FIFA's operations to those investigating alleged corruption at a rally for his Independent Liberal Party."I also will give them my knowledge of financial transactions at FIFA including, but not limited to, Sepp Blatter. I have been there for 30 consecutive years. I was a heartbeat away from Blatter. I said to him in 2011, 'It's time -- at 75 -- it's time to step down,' " he said.What's next for FIFA?Warner's latest claims came shortly after court records revealed that Chuck Blazer, a former FIFA executive committee member and a key player in the ongoing corruption investigation into international soccer's governing body, had admitted taking bribes.In a 40-page document that federal prosecutors released Wednesday, Blazer tells the court that he and other members of the FIFA executive committee took bribes between 2004 and 2011 and helped South Africa land the 2010 World Cup.He also describes facilitating a bribe in connection with the 1998 World Cup bidding process.U.S. officials have said in another court document that the bribe that Blazer helped to negotiate was paid by Moroccan officials to an unnamed member of FIFA's executive committee. Morocco's bid for the Cup was unsuccessful. France was awarded the 1998 finals.Jacques Lambert, head of France's 1998 World Cup organizing committee, dismissed any notion that France paid a bribe in an interview with France Info radio Thursday, adding that he couldn't speak for the rival nations.Lambert said a member of the French committee who met with Warner at the time had assured him "the only thing M. Warner asked for, is that the French team comes to play a '94 World Cup preparation game at Trinidad and Tobago."Jerome Champagne, ex-deputy secretary general of FIFA, told CNN's French affiliate BFMTV that "the corrupters know very well who they can corrupt."Who is Chuck Blazer?Speaking at his political rally Wednesday, Warner said Blatter had turned against him in 2011 when he advised the Swiss to stand down, saying it should be "tomorrow, not the day after," or he would become a lame duck president of FIFA and people might start to ask if he was cooking the books."I said to him: 'Step down.' I said to him: 'Mr. Blatter, I empathize with you, because I was in 2011 where you are today. The only difference is you caused my demise, I didn't cause yours.' "While promising to dish the dirt on others within FIFA, Warner denied wrongdoing himself."South Africa didn't give me any $10 million bribe," he said. "Blatter didn't give me any bribe."He added, "Blatter knows why he fell. And if there's one other person who knows, I do."Blatter stunned the soccer world Tuesday by announcing his intention to resign, just four days after he was elected president for a fifth term by delegates to FIFA's annual World Congress. According to FIFA rules, the earliest a new leader can be elected would be in four months.According to the lengthy U.S. Justice Department indictment filed last month, Warner -- a former FIFA vice president and one of nine FIFA officials charged last week -- is accused of taking a $10 million bribe to vote for South Africa's 2010 World Cup.South Africa's government denies having paid any bribe to secure the hosting rights.Should FIFA elect a woman to replace Sepp Blatter?FIFA is mired in two investigations right now.The first: A Swiss criminal investigation into the highly controversial 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids, which went to Russia and Qatar, respectively. Authorities have questioned a few people, but no one's been arrested. Blatter's not being questioned as part of the probe, the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland said last week.The second: The U.S. investigation that's targeting alleged wrongdoing that spans 24 years. U.S. prosecutors issued arrest warrants for 14 people, on charges ranging from money laundering to fraud and racketeering.They include FIFA officials who took bribes totaling more than $150 million and in return provided "lucrative media and marketing rights" to soccer tournaments as kickbacks, prosecutors say.The scandal has prompted speculation over whether Russia or Qatar could lose the right to host their respective World Cups if wrongdoing is proved.On Thursday, British Culture Secretary John Whittingdale told the House of Commons that England is willing to host the 2022 Cup if it is taken away from Qatar."Obviously if FIFA came forward and asked us to consider hosting it, we have the facilities in this country and of course we did mount a very impressive, if unsuccessful, bid to host the 2018 World Cup," he said.Russia has repeatedly said there is no reason why it would not keep its hosting rights in 2018.Alexei Sorokin, head of Russia's 2018 organizing committee, told Britain's Guardian newspaper, "We're not afraid of anything. We're organizing the World Cup. If some are trying to take it away, that's their business."The Asian Football Confederation also pledged its support for Qatar 2022 in a statement Thursday, saying the Gulf was a region of passionate soccer lovers."The AFC and the whole Asian football community stands with Qatar and we all look forward to hosting the World Cup, and welcoming the world," it said.Opinion: How FIFA hid a most pernicious evilCNN's Larry Register and Patrick Sung contributed to this report.</corpo>

        <titulo>Chuck Blazer: American soccer bigwig turned informant</titulo>
        <data>data</data>
        <corpo>(CNN)For years, Chuck Blazer was one of the biggest names in U.S. soccer. He traveled the world, lived in swanky apartments, ate at the best restaurants and used offshore bank accounts.He just wasn't paying his taxes. He didn't even file his forms.Blazer was a FIFA executive committee member and at one point the No. 2 man in the soccer governing organization for the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football, or CONCACAF.He is now a key figure in a corruption scandal at the world soccer body: The man who went from raking in illicit millions to secretly recording executives talking about bribery and other graft.A New York Times reporter found Blazer at a New York hospital last week. Blazer mouthed the words, "I can't talk" from his room."We have no comment," said Mary Mulligan, one of his attorneys.FIFA corruption probe targets 'World Cup of fraud,' IRS chief saysAn indictment unsealed on May 27 as U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced charges against 14 other FIFA top figures described the level of Blazer's ill-gotten millions.Blazer had pleaded guilty in 2013 to conspiracy to commit racketeering, wire fraud, money laundering, income tax evasion and failure to report foreign bank accounts, authorities said.He had amassed $11 million in unreported income, said Richard Weber, director of the IRS Criminal Investigation Division.So he became a wire-wearing informant who provided documents and recordings of meetings with FIFA colleagues that hinted at not-so-kosher dealings, law enforcement officials said.The New York Daily News, in a November article, details just how this soccer insider became a cooperating witness for the U.S. federal government using a keychain wired to record audio at the 2012 London Olympics.According to the Daily News, on a November night in 2011, two men -- one from the FBI and one from the IRS -- tailed Blazer as he rode his motorized scooter along a Fifth Avenue sidewalk in Manhattan. They caught up with him and gave him his options.Go to prison for tax evasion or help us out with our soccer corruption investigation."We can take you away in handcuffs now -- or you can cooperate," Blazer reportedly was told, according to the newspaper.Why is the U.S. bringing down the hammer on FIFA?In 2004, Blazer and two co-conspirators worked a deal with the South African government and the country's World Cup bid committee to get $10 million in exchange for votes to bring the 2010 finals to South Africa, the indictment says.The South African Football Association called the allegations baseless and promised to challenge them. South Africa's government has also denied paying any bribe.The indictment says that in the end, the money came from funds from FIFA that should have gone to South Africa and Blazer ended up with more than $750,000 but not all of his promised $1 million, or 10%.Court records released by federal prosecutors on June 3, a week after the indictment was unsealed, reveal that Blazer admitted back in November 2013 that he and other members of the FIFA executive committee took bribes between 2004 and 2011 and helped South Africa land the World Cup.The 40-page court document is a transcript of Blazer's appearance before a judge in the Eastern District of New York.Blazer, who was on FIFA's executive committee from 1997 to 2013, also describes facilitating a bribe in connection with the 1998 World Cup bidding process.U.S. officials have said in another court document that the bribe that Blazer helped to negotiate was paid by Moroccan officials to an unnamed member of FIFA's executive committee. Morocco's bid for the Cup was unsuccessful. France was awarded the 1998 finals."During my association with FIFA and CONCACAF, among other things, I and others agreed that I or a co-conspirator would commit at least two acts of racketeering activity," he says in the court document.In the transcript, he reveals he has rectal cancer, coronary artery disease and diabetes, but says his cancer prognosis is good and he is holding up reasonably well, even though he uses a wheelchair.BuzzFeed, in a June 2014, article, says Mr. 10 Percent was Blazer's nickname. It reported that years ago, he signed a lucrative contract with CONCACAF that "entitled him to 10% -- under his unilateral interpretation -- of just about every penny the organization brought in."Blazer's income really took off after the hugely successful 1994 World Cup in the United States.The day after the finals ended, Blazer signed a new contract with the same 10% cut, according to a report by CONCACAF. But this time, CONCACAF said, the money went through an entity in the Cayman Islands.CONCACAF, in the same report, found that the 10% cut that it contends contractually only should have applied to sponsorships and TV rights fees instead came off of every dime the organization took in. This included "match promotion proceeds from the sales of tournament match tickets, luxury suite rentals, parking, and venue concessions."FIFA: What's the deal with world football's governing body?Blazer, who is now 70, used his millions on good food and nice living. He even had a $6,000-a-month spot in New York's Trump Tower for his cats, the Daily News reported.CONCACAF notes that between 1996 and 2011, it paid well over $800,000 in rent for apartments "used by Blazer."He left CONCACAF in 2011 and FIFA in 2013, both times after controversy.In May 2011, Blazer handed to FIFA a report accusing two of its most high-profile members -- Jack Warner, who ran CONCACAF and was a FIFA vice president, and Mohamed bin Hammam, head of the Asian Football Confederation -- of bribery at a Caribbean Football Union meeting early that month. (Warner was one of the 14 people indicted on May 27.)Warner resigned, and bin Hammam is now banned for life by FIFA. Bin Hammam denied the allegations, and Blazer stepped down from CONCACAF five months after the report was issued.FIFA suspended Blazer in May 2013 after an ethics committee found he probably had received at least $15 million in addition to other funds that were used to buy and rent luxury apartments. He left his position when his term ran out, and the FIFA investigation was called off.What wasn't known at the time was that he'd already been indicted in the United States on corruption charges, along with three other people.How FIFA makes its billions</corpo>

        <titulo>'Sea change' in Catholic sex abuse scandal</titulo>
        <data>data</data>
        <corpo>(CNN)Pope Francis has created a church tribunal to judge bishops who fail to protect children from sexually abusive priests, the Vatican announced Wednesday, a move long sought by abuse victims and their advocates.The new court will be part of the powerful Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Catholic Church's chief watchdog. Since 2001, the congregation has judged priests accused of sexual abuse, but there has been no Vatican office with a similar role to judge bishops.The Rev. Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said the Pope will appoint a secretary and permanent staff for the tribunal. The tribunal was proposed by the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, which was appointed last year by Pope Francis.Longtime critics of the Vatican called Wednesday's move a "sea change" within the Catholic Church."Priests abuse children, and so do bishops," said Terence McKiernan, president of the watchdog group BishopAccountability.org. "Bishops who offend are inevitable enablers, and the commission's plan must confront that sad fact."Critics of the church's handling of its sexual abuse scandal, which has involved thousands of priests and victims, have often argued that bishops who quietly shuffled abusive priests from parish to parish -- tacitly allowing the crimes to continue -- should be punished.To date, one American bishop, Robert Finn of Kansas City, has been removed from office. Finn was convicted in 2012 on charges of failing to report suspected child abuse. The Vatican accepted Finn's resignation in April, though without offering a reason.Last week, prosecutors in Minnesota charged the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis with six counts related to a sexually abusive ex-priest.Advocates for sexual abuse victims gave the new tribunal qualified approval."Time will tell whether these moves actually result in holding bishops accountable for cover-ups of crimes," Boston-based church reform group Voice of the Faithful said. "But these steps are the most promising the Vatican has yet taken."The new court was advocated by Boston Cardinal Sean O'Malley, who has long pushed the Vatican to discipline bishops who failed to protect children. But at their semi-annual meeting in St. Louis on Wednesday, U.S. Catholic bishops seemed taken by surprise at the move. Several suggested they first heard of the new tribunal by reading news reports Wednesday morning."I don't have a lot of background information on it," said Archbishop Joseph Kurtz, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. However, Kurtz said, he welcomes the Pope's new tribunal. "We are eager to cooperate, and we know it's a direction that we have to take seriously."Archbishop Thomas Wenski of Miami, who is also in St. Louis for the meeting of Catholic bishops, said the tribunal does not represent the first time that popes have held bishops accountable."Throughout history popes have deposed bishops for various reasons," he said.Few, however, have been deposed during the church's devastating sexual abuse scandal.</corpo>

        <titulo>Actor appeals for help fighting ISIS</titulo>
        <data>data</data>
        <corpo>(CNN)For British actor Michael Enright, the release of video footage by ISIS showing the August killing of U.S. journalist James Foley first motivated him to make the difficult journey into Syria to join the fight against the terror group."It was heartbreaking, it was shocking, it made me angry," he said. The subsequent killings of other hostages from Britain and Japan, and ISIS' persecution of the Yazidi minority in Iraq, only hardened his resolve to help out however he could, he said.The 51-year-old, who's volunteering with Kurdish fighters in Syria, has now appealed for the United Kingdom to give the Kurds more help in their battle against the Sunni extremists.Speaking to CNN from Rojava, a Kurdish enclave in northern Syria, Enright said the Kurdish forces had the heart and will to fight but needed more air support to cut off ISIS supply routes. The actor left Los Angeles in March for Syria, traveling via Turkey and Iraq.While Enright is clear his mission is to help the Kurds, whom he sees as friends and comrades, others have been more skeptical.Last week, a former U.S. Army serviceman who has turned recruiter for foreigners eager to fight with Kurdish forces against ISIS claimed in a Facebook post that Enright was a liability who is in danger of being killed by his own comrades.Jordan Matson of Sturtevant, Wisconsin, said that Enright had been kicked out of four fighting units and had been asked to leave twice by the Kurdish People's Protection Units, or YPG.He also questioned the actor's state of mind, said he was carrying around an AK-47 that had been disabled by his own side, and suggested Enright was there writing a movie script.Matson repeated some of these claims directly to CNN, which reported on the Facebook post, via an online chat forum. A second American fighting with the YPG also told CNN that Westerners had made threats against Enright.Kurdish forces in Iraq and Syria have been among the most effective counterbalances to ISIS' expansion. In Syria, the YPG's high-profile battle to keep the town of Kobani from ISIS control dominated news coverage last year.Enright declined to name anyone behind the negative media coverage last week. But he insisted the claims made were not based on fact and said he was baffled by the coverage of what he described as "tittle-tattle" and Internet gossip.He has two cameras with him, Enright said, and the Kurds -- having learned that he was an actor who had worked in TV and movies -- asked him to film what was going on. While in Hollywood, the actor played small parts in "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," "Old Dogs" and "Knight and Day.""I've not been asked to leave by four generals, I've not put a gun in my mouth or wanted to kill myself, I've not been threatened in any way by the Kurds," Enright said. "I love the Kurds and the unit I'm in is the best -- it's something about being in a situation like this (that) brings out something very special, definitely, in me and in the lads that I could never replicate in civilian life."He also said his gun was "just fine" and that he had never started writing a movie script and had no plans to do so."This is about the evil that is called ISIS and exterminating it from the face of the earth," he said, in response to claims he was interested in self-promotion. "It's about substantial things, real things."Enright, originally from Manchester in northern England, said he was concerned about the impact of the negative coverage on his family back home, explaining that was the reason he was speaking to the media again now.The real story is the suffering of the Syrian people and the efforts of the Kurds to push back ISIS, he said.Asked by CNN about Enright's rejection of his claims, Matson stood by what he had said.CNN has reached out to the YPG for comment but has not yet had a response.Enright called on the UK government under Prime Minister David Cameron to revisit its decision not to deploy air support for anti-ISIS fighters in Syria.Britain launched its first airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq last fall, following authorization from the UK Parliament. But the motion passed by lawmakers stipulated that any proposal to expand the strikes to Syria would require additional action by Parliament.Enright said that the Kurds were being hampered in their fight by the continued existence of ISIS-controlled territory between the areas they control -- the Kurdish cantons of Kobani, Cizire and Efrin -- which allow the Sunni extremists to maintain supply lines from over the Turkish border.He had seen evidence of this firsthand in villages the Kurds liberated from ISIS, he said, where the extremists left behind packaging for food from Turkey."I know (Cameron) has a lot on his plate right now with the European Union, Ukraine, but if it's possible we really, really do need help," he said.As for his own role in Syria, Enright said he was not making plans for the future but had made a commitment to stay until ISIS was completely pushed out of Rojava.CNN's Gul Tuysuz contributed to this report.</corpo>

        <corpo>Washington (CNN)President Barack Obama's administration is planning to train Sunni tribes' fighters as part of its move to send up to 450 additional U.S. forces to Iraq, the White House said Wednesday.The United States is also sending weapons to Sunni tribes, as well as the Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, who are operating under Iraqi command, in order to fight the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.The hope, an Obama administration official said, is that a new "Sunni uprising" similar to one that took place in 2013 will occur - but this time, aimed at Islamic State fighters."This is designed to focus on training the Sunnis," the official said.The additional U.S. military personnel will train and advise Iraqi and tribal troops at the Taqaddum military base in eastern Anbar province.Sunni fighters will continue with the standard practice of undergoing a security review by the Iraq's before they are permitted to join, to ensure they do not have loyalties to ISIS, the official said.RELATED: Obama says 'no complete strategy' in training Iraqi troopsThe Associated Press was the first to report earlier Tuesday that the administration was considering sending up to 1,000 U.S. forces to the country.Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey told reporters traveling with him in Jerusalem on Tuesday that Obama has asked military brass to "take a look at what we've learned over the last eight months in the train-and-equip program and make recommendations to him on whether there are capabilities that we may want to provide to the Iraqis to actually make them more capable."RELATED: Rumsfeld defends remarks about democracy in Iraq"He's asked us to look at whether there are other locations where we might establish training sites," Dempsey said. "He's asked us to take a look at how we might develop Iraq's leaders."There are currently about 3,050 U.S. forces in Iraq. Roughly 2,250 of them are devoted to supporting Iraqi security forces, approximately 450 are training Iraqi troops and about 200 more are acting in advising and assisting roles.CNN's Jim Acosta contributed to this report.</corpo>

        <titulo>Exclusive: Iraqi troops prepare to combat ISIS</titulo>

        <corpo>Habbaniyah, Iraq (CNN)Iraq's history is writ large among the ruins of Habbaniyah military base: wrecked aircraft, crumbling buildings and much-used military hardware all telling a part of the country's troubled tale.A relic of the British Empire, Habbaniyah fell into the hands of Saddam Hussein when he came to power in 1979; what little remains of his regime's MIG fighter jets lie in the dust at the roadside.Taken over and built up by the U.S. as they tried to stabilize Anbar province, the sprawling base was handed over to the Iraqi army when American troops withdrew from the region.In the years since, cared for by an Iraqi army who at times look as if they have been left to fend for themselves, it has become overgrown and neglected in places.But now, Habbaniyah is preparing for a key role in the fight against ISIS, as the staging ground for the Iraqi government's attempt to take Ramadi back from the terror group.CNN was the first western television network to be granted access to the base since Ramadi fell to ISIS.Iraqi military officials insist they have the men and the tools they need to attack Ramadi, but complain bitterly at what they say is a lack of coalition air support.The base and its troops are under constant harassment by ISIS forces stationed just across the river that runs along the northern edge of the base.With machine guns rattling away just behind him, Major-General Khalil Abadi explained that the ISIS positions currently firing on his men appear low down the list of targets for Iraqi and coalition jets."They are supposed to give us some support now from warplanes," he said, appealing for greater backing from the coalition. "We are in control of the ground, all we need is air support."The nature of the threat was clear in a brief visit to the front lines: ISIS are separated from the base by the flow of the River Euphrates, but further upstream they have used the Ramadi Dam to cut off much of its flow.The rise and rise of ISISSome believe the river may drop low enough to allow ISIS troops to attack the base.For now, at least, the military is pumping water in from nearby Habbaniyah Lake to keep levels high -- and keep the enemy at bay.Maj-Gen. Abadi was at the base to inspect its readiness but also to offer words of support to the men stationed there, praising what he called their "steadfastness" in the face of ISIS.But while Iraq's state media has portrayed Habbaniyah as the base for a large counter-offensive, the area seen by CNN seemed comparatively empty, with no sense of a massive force being prepared to attack.The Iraqi military was there, as were Shia fighting groups -- particularly the well-resourced Iraqi Hezbollah brigades -- but there was no sign of the Sunni fighters who were said to be gathering in readiness for an assault on Ramadi.One Iraqi official said these Sunni men -- vital to ensure the offensive to retake the Sunni heartland of Anbar from being a predominantly Shia operation -- numbered 2,000 "on paper" but were more likely only 500 strong in reality.Why ISIS is winning and how to stop it</corpo>

        <titulo>Iraqi vet who's seen it all: ISIS in Mosul to stay</titulo>
        <data>data</data>
        <corpo>Baghdad (CNN)We had just finished up our shoot in Al-Makasib Girls' Elementary School in Baghdad's Saadoun neighbourhood and were loading the gear into the car when a man sitting in a wheelchair across the courtyard beckoned to me."Come, talk to me, too," he said.He introduced himself as Louay Hikmat Shawkat, Iraqi Army veteran of the war with Iran and then the 1991 Kuwait war, refugee from Mosul and a self-described translator of English, French, "Canadian" and "Yugoslavian."Given that the latter two aren't languages, and his English was a tad scratchy, I was intrigued.We were visiting the school to talk to its current "residents" -- 48 Christian families who had fled Mosul when ISIS took over a year ago. Mosul, in northern Iraq and one of the nation's largest cities, is about 405 kilometers (about 250 miles) from the capital of Baghdad. But for these internal refugees, it might as well be a world away.I asked Louay, who is 60, when he thought he might be able to return home."Take it out of your mind that ISIS is going to leave Mosul," he insisted, gesturing with his hand as if he were pulling a thread out of his head.The chances he and his wife will someday return to their home in the Mosul suburb of Hamdaniya, he said, are "one in a hundred. One in a million!"Louay said he suffers from diabetes, but he insists on lighting up another cigarette in his nicotine-stained fingers "because I get upset whenever I speak about "Da'ish", the Arabic acronym for ISIS.ISIS, he said, "is an illness. It's impossible to cure. Cancer can be cured, tuberculosis can be cured. Almost every illness can be cured, but not this one."His diabetes causes him to suffer from dizziness whenever he stands up. "If I were well," he vows, "I would go fight them myself."Like everyone else I spoke with at the school, he is desperate to leave Iraq, but his attempts to apply for asylum have come to naught. His last hope, he told me with a mischievous grin, is an old Canadian girlfriend in Montreal.In the school's makeshift kitchen, I met Linda Jannan, who was busy with the washing up.She fled Mosul with her husband and three children in August, first going to Dohuk, in Iraqi Kurdistan, where they spent six months in a tent in a refugee camp.A thin women in her 30s with the dark circles under her eyes, she also was desperate to leave Iraq."We are finished," she told me. "Our future, our children, our men have been destroyed. We're too afraid to go out and find work. If only someone outside Iraq will help us find a solution, let us emigrate. We have no hope left."She and her husband had applied to asylum in the United States and Germany, but they were rejected because they have no close relatives in either country.Obama: No 'complete strategy' yet on training IraqisOver the past few months, these refugees have been visited by a variety of reporters. And it's clear their patience is wearing thin."What's the point of all this talk?" one man asked me, after declining my request for an on-camera interview. "We talk, we talk, and nothing happens," he snapped.Firyal Abdel Kareem, who was sharing the kitchen with Linda Jannan, is at her wits' end. She spent the winter months in a windy tent in Zakho, near the Turkish border, and is now suffering from Baghdad's sweltering summer heat."Find a solution for us," she told me, "it's enough. We are tired.""Either they take us out of here, or send us home. Do we have to stay in this school, or in a tent?"I've been covering Iraq since 1994. I covered the impact of the draconian international sanctions imposed on the country after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. I covered the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 and the messy, bloody aftermath. And now I'm back covering the war against ISIS.I'm lucky. I come and go as I please. For the people in this school, there is no such luxury. Thair Al-Naim, his wife and their three young sons left behind a relatively comfortable life in Mosul last summer. He's now penniless and out of work, all his construction equipment seized and sold by ISIS.Speaking to him in the classroom they now call "home," I sense a deep weariness with a life that, for too long, has been fraught with violence and fear."Since the fall of Saddam," he sighs, "all we've had is war after war, and now we have Da'ish."CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali contributed to this report.</corpo>

        <titulo>2 killed near Egypt tourist site</titulo>
        <data>data</data>
        <corpo>(CNN)Two assailants were killed and one injured in a thwarted attack at Karnak Temple in Luxor, Egypt, on Wednesday morning, authorities said.The attackers confronted security officials at Karnak with firearms and explosives, Egypt's Interior Ministry said in a statement.The three men, who were in a car, tried to enter the temple's parking lot when a plainclothes policeman forced it to stop, Egypt's Tourism Ministry said. Security forces confronted them, and two were killed: one died when he detonated the explosives he was carrying, and another was shot in the head, the Interior Ministry added.The third militant was injured.Egypt's Health Ministry said in a statement that five people were injured, including civilians."The policeman who stopped the vehicle sustained minor injuries, but due to his heroic actions, many other potential victims were saved and thankfully no tourists were harmed," Tourism Minister Khaled Rami said.Typically, thousands of tourists visit Luxor and Karnak Temple daily.After the attack, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi ordered an intensified security presence at vital sites in the country, including sites of antiquity, el-Sisi's office told CNN.Egypt's minister of antiquity and minister of tourism were in Luxor on Wednesday to assess the situation.This is the first deadly attack on a Luxor tourist site since 1997, when gunmen killed 62 people -- most of them international tourists.The recent targeting of tourist sites represents a major escalation by Islamist militants in Egypt.Last week, gunmen shot and killed two police officers in an attack a few hundred meters from the Great Pyramids of Giza, the Interior Ministry said.Previously, militants, including the ISIS-aligned Ansar Beit Al Maqdis, mostly targeted Egyptian government officials and security forces. But four people were killed and 14 wounded when Ansar Beit Al Maqdis targeted a bus of South Korean tourists traveling from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula into Israel in February 2014.Militants have killed hundreds of policemen and soldiers since the overthrow of Islamist President Mohamed Morsy in July 2013.Recently, they expanded their targets to include judges.Wednesday's attack coincided with the signing of the African Tripartite Free Trade Agreement in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Several African leaders, including el-Sisi, are attending the summit in the Sinai Peninsula, hundreds of kilometers away from the site of Wednesday's attack.In a post last month on its official Arabic website, the Muslim Brotherhood appeared to endorse a call to arms by urging followers to "resist this coup by all means until the fall of the regime" and asserted the "legitimate right to self-defense."Security forces have arrested anyone belonging to or accused of working with the Brotherhood, a group designated by Egypt as a terrorist organization. Hundreds of Islamists and their supporters have been killed in the crackdown.The Egyptian government has been trying to lure back tourists for the summer high season.Tourism represents 11.3% of Egypt's gross domestic product and 19.3% of its foreign currency revenues, Egypt's State Information Services says."The government of Egypt places the highest priority on the safety of tourists in our country," said Rami, the tourism minister. "We have enhanced security measures in place at all our sites, and we continue to take every possible measure to ensure that no harm comes to anyone visiting Egypt."</corpo>
